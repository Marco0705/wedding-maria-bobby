    "title": "Our Story",
    "p1": "We met briefly in 2017 with a casual conversation that lasted less than a minute. We left as strangers but, two months later, Maria took a boxing class that I was running. I asked Maria on a date and was promptly turned down. My second attempt wasn’t.",
    "p2": "I was a college senior, and Maria was visiting the States for her au pair year. She had only seven months left when we met, so we decided to make every second count. We went to the movies, played laser tag and mini golf, took an RV trip, joined a Brooklyn pizza tour, partied in the city, represented Scotland in the Beer Olympics, and climbed mountains in Acadia.",
    "p3": "And then one summer day at Sandy Beach in Cohasset, Maria asked me, “Can you imagine how much we will have to go through to stay together?”",
    "p4": "That summer passed as fast as summer always does. And when it did, it was time for Maria to return home. But she didn’t leave without tickets for a flight back to Boston in October. After that, we planned a six-week visit for me to go to Madrid and meet her family. We would visit each other seven times over the next two years.",
    "p5": "Finally, on February 2, 2020, I proposed to Maria at Logan Airport. Just one month later, COVID meant Maria couldn’t even go out into the streets of Madrid, let alone get on an airplane.",
    "p6": "We wouldn’t see each other again for 586 days.",
    "p7": "But just fourteen days after we were reunited, we became husband and wife in a barefoot wedding ceremony in my parents backyard, Bob and Robin’s backyard.",
    "p8": "Andres and Marisol watched their daughter get married in another country, from a TV screen. On May X, we are excited to give them—and the rest of our Spanish family—the wedding they deserve.",
